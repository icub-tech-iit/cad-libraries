  All position constraints can't be simultaneously satisfied. 
The following position constraints can't be satisfied:


1) Lower limit of the first rotation axis in connection Connection_47 in model
IC_033_G_029 (component id path [118041,33033]) can't be satisfied.


2) Upper limit of the first rotation axis in connection Connection_36 in model
IC_033_G_029 (component id path [118041,33033]) can't be satisfied.


3) Constraint of the first rotation axis in connection Connection_36 in model
IC_033_G_029 (component id path [118041,33033]) can't be satisfied.


4) The following kinematic loop can't be closed: body3 - body1 - body2 - body3.
